## EU-27 Trade Network Analysis Project

Welcome to the EU-27 Trade Network Analysis project! This repository provides a comprehensive analysis of the trade relationships within the European Union (EU) using advanced network analysis techniques. The primary goal is to understand the economic interactions driving the EU's single market and address challenges such as vulnerabilities, dependencies, and inefficiencies within the trade network.

### Project Overview

### Objective
- Examine the flow of trade goods within the EU-27 to identify patterns and trends in intra-EU trade dynamics.
- Provide actionable insights for policy-making to enhance economic strategies and resilience of the EU economy.

### Scope
- Covers all 27 member states of the EU, excluding the United Kingdom post-Brexit.
- Focuses on 2022 trade data.

### Methodology

#### Data Collection
- **Source**: European Commission's Access2Markets portal.
- **Content**: Value and volume of imports and exports across all EU-27 member states.

#### Network Analysis Tools & Techniques
- **Python Libraries**: NetworkX, Matplotlib.
- **Nodes**: Represent countries.
- **Edges**: Represent trade flows, filtered to include only those above 1 billion euros.

### Analysis Components

1. **Network Structure - Global Descriptors**
   - Number of nodes: 27
   - Number of edges: 191 (trade balance > 1 billion euros)
   - Key metrics: Average degree, average distance, density, clustering coefficient, Kirchhoff index, and random walk index.

2. **Regional Analysis - Community Detection**
   - Algorithms: Infomap and Louvain method.
   - Identified economically coherent communities within the EU.

3. **Individual Member Analysis - Local Descriptors**
   - Focused on France, Spain, and the Netherlands.
   - Key metrics: Eccentricity, degree, clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and trade strength.

### Key Findings
- **Network Integration**: Highly integrated network with dense connections and a compact structure.
- **Community Dynamics**: Identified distinct trade communities with shared economic characteristics.
- **Country-Specific Insights**: Detailed analysis of France's trade deficit, Spain's balanced trade, and the Netherlands' role as a trade hub.

### Recommendations
- Enhance connectivity and equitable trade benefits across the EU.
- Address trade balance disparities.
- Support sector-specific growth and diversification strategies.
- Develop policies based on community dynamics to foster economic cohesion.

### Future Research
- Incorporate dynamic analysis to capture evolving trade relationships.
- Dive deeper into sector-specific trade flows.
- Examine the impact of non-EU trade relationships.
- Align findings with recent EU trade policies, such as the European Green Deal.

### Repository Contents
- **Data**: All relevant trade data and processed datasets.
- **Code**: Python scripts for data processing, network construction, and analysis.
- **Reports**: Detailed analysis report and presentation slides.

Thank you for your interest in the EU-27 Trade Network Analysis project! We hope this analysis provides valuable insights for enhancing the economic strategies and resilience of the EU.
